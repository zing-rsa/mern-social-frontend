## Mern-social-frontend

Mern Social is a code project that aims to simulate a social media similar to Twitter, where users can create accounts, log in, and post short messages + media to share with others. Users can also follow and unfollow each other, as well as like and reply to posts.
The primary purpose of this project is to explore the JavaScript(MERN) ecosystem and improve my skills in React and API design.
Thanks for checking it out.
